# 🎤 Bark Battle

A real-time competitive barking platform for K-pop fans to practice their concert skills!

## 🎯 Pitch

As fans of K-pop, we want to practice our barking to prepare for the concerts that we will eventually go to. Our platform aims to solve this issue by creating a competitive environment where fans can hone their skills.

Bark Battle pairs 2 players together in an epic bark-off competition. Whoever barks the loudest for a Chaewon fancam wins the round and claims victory! 🏆

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time matchmaking** - Get paired with another player instantly
- **Live audio competition** - Bark your heart out and let the volume decide the winner
- **Chaewon fancam integration** - Bark along to exclusive fancam content
- **Instant results** - See who barked the loudest in real-time
