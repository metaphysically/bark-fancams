# 🎤 Bark Battle

A real-time competitive barking platform for K-pop fans to practice their concert skills!

## 🎯 Pitch

As fans of K-pop, we want to practice our barking to prepare for the concerts that we will eventually go to. Our platform aims to solve this issue by creating a competitive environment where fans can hone their skills.
